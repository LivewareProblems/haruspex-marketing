Our Mission

We believe that the current status of tooling for tech operators is, at best,  a local maxima. We believe that the best and easiest way to make tools better in Tech is to concentrate on the ability of operators of tech to liberate their potential. We consider anything that do not follow these principles to be a personal insult. Our anger about the state of the art and the inadequacy of the conditions operators of tech have to work in is what motivate us.

We can summarise this mission by three principles

1. We can have nice things
2. Taking Human Performance Seriously
3. Make it Personal

Principles

These are the basis of anything we consider. We cannot exchange them for others and we should strive to use them as our North Star.

Integrity, Honesty, Human Rights

Values

Values are guiding principles. They are not fundamental as Principles can be, but they help us take decision everyday. They are regularly in tension, but that is ok. the order of them does not particularly matter, but we believe that in following them, we will have a better business

1. Sustainability
2. Transparency
3. Diversity
4. Responsibility
5. Collaboration
6. Learning
7. Expertise
8. Curiosity
